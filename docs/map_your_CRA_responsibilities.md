## 1\. Map your CRA responsibilities 

If the product you sell, manufacture, or distribute connects to the Internet, processes data, or relies on software, you’re responsible for ensuring the entire supply chain meets compliance standards. 

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) mandates that **all products with digital elements be secure by design**, and applies to a wide range of connected products, like: 

- IoT devices,  
- Edge computing hardware,   
- Firmware, Software and Client Applications,  
- Cloud services connected to physical devices,   
- Products connected directly or indirectly to another device or network including machinery.

Manufacturers, service providers, distributors, and importers need to comply with the EU’s CRA, having to meet strict cybersecurity requirements, report exploited vulnerabilities, cooperate with authorities, and maintain compliance documentation.

CRA requires products to be designed with protected data transmission, verified software updates, and long-term vulnerability management. Even if you’re using third-party components.

> **Exclusion \-** Medical devices, aviation, and  motor vehicles that are already covered by existing rules are not subject to the CRA. ([Article 2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_2))


Once you determine if you are affected, you need to identify your role in the IoT supply chain and what CRA expects from you:

### Device or software manufacturer
You are responsible for designing secure products, providing software updates, vulnerability management, and lifecycle support. 

### Cloud Service Provider
If you offer a cloud service for your products that either defines, controls or secures the products itself, this entire cloud service is considered the remote data processing for the product, and needs to comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements as well. ([Recital 11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#rct_11) & [Recital 12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#rct_12))

*Balena provides secure and ISO 27001:2022 audited cloud services. By using balena’s cloud services you already comply with the CRA remote data processing requirements for device management, vulnerability updates and fleet observation.* 

### Distributor
Duties are described in [Article 20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_20), obligating distributors to act with due care to ensure that the products they supply comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements.

### Importer
Duties are described in [Article 19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_19), obligating distributors to act with due care to ensure that the products they supply comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements.
