## 8\. Declaration of Conformity

All products with digital elements require an **[EU Declaration of Conformity](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_28)** before they can be placed on the EU market. This declaration affirms that the product meets the essential cybersecurity requirements outlined in the CRA.

The specific obligations for manufacturers to draw up this declaration are detailed in [Article 28](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_28) of the CRA. Additionally, [Annex V](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_V) defines the required content such as product identification, manufacturer's details, and statement of compliance

[Annex VI](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_VI) allows to ship a simplified Declaration of Conformity with the product and link to a full digital version available on the internet.

It's important to note that while all products require this declaration, the process for demonstrating conformity must be done either by a third party or internally, depending on the product category::

**Default Category Products** – Manufacturers can perform a self-assessment to ensure compliance.

**Important and Critical Products** – These categories may necessitate third-party assessments or certifications due to their higher cybersecurity risks.
