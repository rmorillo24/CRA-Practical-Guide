Products placed on the market before December 11, 2027, are only required to report incidents, handle vulnerabilities and provide security updates ([Article 14\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_14)**.** They **don’t need** to meet CRA’s broader security design and compliance rules unless new features or other modifications changing the risk assessment are made to the product after that date ([Article 69](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_69))

## Dates when regulators will update

With the CRA enacted and an adoption period extending until **11 December 2027**, regulation and standardization groups are still in the process of establishing a solid foundation for building products based on industry standards 

On **17 April 2024**, the EU Commission published a draft **standardization request** for European Standards Organizations to support Union policy on cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. In response, CENELEC and ENISA are working on the adoption of supporting standards for the 41 standardization requests issued by the EU.

According to CENELEC, the first drafts of supporting standards are expected by the end of 2025, with final adoption of standardization requests in August 2026.

Meanwhile, by **11 December 2025**, the EU Commission will adopt a technical description of product categories to help manufacturers assess where their products fit ([Article 7.4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art7))

Also, by **11 December 2025**, the EU Commission will define the terms and conditions for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), which each EU member state must establish to manage cybersecurity incident notifications ([Article 14.9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_14)).

 If you are a manufacturer, you will be required to notify your designated CSIRT of any exploited vulnerabilities or information security incident**s** involving your product.
