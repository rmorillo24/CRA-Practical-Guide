## 9 Plan for Product Lifecycle & End-of-Life (EOL) 

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) requires manufacturers to ensure at least 5 years of product security support, unless the product’s lifetime is less, and define a clear End-of-Life (EOL) strategy to prevent security risks from outdated or abandoned devices. This means businesses must not only secure their products at launch but also provide updates, patches, and a structured decommissioning process when support ends. 

### Declare a Product Lifecycle Support Period
Clearly state how long your product will receive security updates and maintenance. The support period must align with the market expectation for the product category \- and unless exceptions \- not be shorter than five years. ([Article 13, 8\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_13)

### Ensure Continuous Updateability
[Annex II, Section 8(c](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_II)) states that products with digital elements must support secure software and firmware updates throughout their lifecycle. OTA (Over-the-Air) updates ensure critical security patches are deployed remotely and easily.  
*Balena provides automatic and remote updates of firmware and software to simplify compliance.* 

### Plan for Secure Decommissioning at EOL
When a device reaches end-of-life, it must be securely retired to prevent unauthorized access, following requirements in [Annex II,8(d)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_II). Implement device wipe mechanisms to remove sensitive data before disposal or repurposing*.*  
*Balena allows remote deactivation of devices, and functionalities to remove applications and user data.*

### Communicate EOL Information to Users
Inform customers in advance about EOL timelines, including the final update release date, security risks of continuing usage, and recommendations for replacement or migration. Provide clear guidelines for transitioning to newer, supported versions, as required by [Annex II.7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_II).
