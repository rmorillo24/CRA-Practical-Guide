## 1\. Map your CRA responsibilities 

You need to identify your role in the IoT supply chain and what CRA expects from you:

**Device or software manufacturer –** You are responsible for designing secure products, providing software updates, vulnerability management, and lifecycle support. 

**Cloud Service Provider –** If you offer a cloud service for your products that either defines, controls or secures the products itself, this entire cloud service is considered the remote data processing for the product, and needs to comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements as well. ([Recital 11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#rct_11) & [Recital 12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#rct_12))

*Balena provides secure and ISO 27001:2022 audited cloud services. By using balena’s cloud services you already comply with the CRA remote data processing requirements for device management, vulnerability updates and fleet observation.* 

**Distributor –** Duties are described in [Article 20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_20), obligating distributors to act with due care to ensure that the products they supply comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements.

**Importer –** Duties are described in [Article 19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_19), obligating distributors to act with due care to ensure that the products they supply comply with the CRA's cybersecurity requirements.
