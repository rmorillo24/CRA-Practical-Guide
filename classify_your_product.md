## 2\. Classify your product

Your product’s classification determines which compliance steps you need to follow under the Cyber Resilience Act. When classifying your product, you need to consider the **Risk Assessment** (explained below) and assign it to one of the following categories:

*Right now the detailed understanding of the categories is missing from the regulation and you may struggle to identify the correct category.  In [Article 7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_7) the European Commission declares they will adopt technical descriptions of the categories of products with digital elements by **11\. Dec. 2025**. You can expect more clarity on your product category by then.*

### Critical Products
These are products with a high-security impact that could cause widespread harm. Those products are Hardware Devices with Security Boxes, Smart meter gateways within smart metering systems**,** and Smartcards or similar devices, including secure elements**.** ([Article 8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_8) & [Annex IV](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_IV))

### Important Products
These have a *moderate to high cybersecurity risk* and are split into *Class I and Class II*, depending on their potential impact ([Annex III)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#anx_III). Examples include smart home security devices (e.g., smart locks, baby monitors), VPN software, operating systems, routers, and firewalls*.* While Class I products can be self-assessed only if the manufacturer applies harmonized standards, class 2 always requires third-party assessment. ([Article 32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_32) & [Annex VIII Part II](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#anx_VIII))

### Default Category
If your product *does not* fall under the Important or Critical categories, it remains in the default group. This covers low-risk consumer electronics like smart light bulbs or fitness trackers. Here, the manufacturer can *self-assess* compliance. ([Article 32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_32) & [Annex VIII Part](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#anx_VIII) I)

### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS
If your software is not sold commercially (e.g., a community-driven open-source encryption tool), it may be exempt from some requirements. However, if integrated into a commercial product, the manufacturer is responsible to meet cybersecurity rules.
