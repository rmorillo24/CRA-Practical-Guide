## Key Points About the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

### Mandatory Cybersecurity for Products with Digital Elements
The CRA requires all products with digital elements and their remote data processing services placed on the EU market to meet strict cybersecurity standards, ensuring they are designed, developed, and maintained securely.

### Security Throughout the Product Lifecycle
Manufacturers must provide long-term security support, including regular updates and vulnerability patches for the declared lifetime of their products. [(Recital 60\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#rct_60)

### Vulnerabilities & Reporting
Products must be made available without known exploitable vulnerabilities. Companies must monitor, address, and report security vulnerabilities, and exploited vulnerabilities must be notified to EU authorities within 24 hours [(Article 14\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_14).

### Supply Chain & Compliance Accountability
Businesses are responsible for ensuring third-party components and vendors meet cybersecurity requirements, reducing risks from insecure supply chains.

### Market Surveillance
The EU surveillance authorities will actively monitor products with digital elements and assess if they comply with the regulation. ([Article 52](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#art_52))

### Product Recalls
If a product fails to meet cybersecurity requirements, market surveillance authorities can require you to take corrective actions, withdraw the product from the market or issue a full product recall. ([Recital 111](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng#rct_111))

### Penalties for Non-Compliance
Companies that fail to comply can face fines of up to €15 million or 2.5% of global annual revenue, making security a business-critical obligation. ([Recital 64](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#art_64))
